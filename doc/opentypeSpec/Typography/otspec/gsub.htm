          Substitution Table</FONT>
        <P>The Glyph Substitution table (GSUB) contains information for substituting 
         glyphs to render the scripts and language systems supported in a font. Many 
         language systems require glyph substitutes. For example, in the Arabic script, 
         the glyph shape that depicts a particular character varies according to its 
         position in a word or text string (see figure 1). In other language systems, 
         glyph substitutes are aesthetic options for the user, such as the use of 
         ligature glyphs in the English language (see Figure 2).<BR>

         <B>Overview</B>
        <P>
        Many fonts use limited character encoding standards that map glyphs to 
        characters one-to-one, assigning a glyph to each character code value in a 
        font. Multiple character codes cannot be mapped to a single glyph, as needed 
        for ligature glyphs, and multiple glyphs cannot be mapped to a single character 
        code, as needed to decompose a ligature into its component glyphs.
        <P>
        To supply glyph substitutes, font developers must assign different character 
        codes to the glyphs, or they must create additional fonts or character sets. To 
        access these glyphs, users must bear the burden of switching between character 
        codes, character sets, or fonts.
        <P><BR>
         <B>Substituting Glyphs with OpenType<FONT COLOR="#999999" STYLE="FONT-SIZE: 7pt; COLOR: #999999"><SUP>TM</SUP></FONT></B>
        <P>
        The OpenType GSUB table fully supports glyph substitution. To access glyph 
        substitutes, GSUB maps from the glyph index or indices defined in a cmap table 
        to the glyph index or indices of the glyph substitutes. For example, if a font 
        has three alternative forms of an ampersand glyph, the cmap table associates 
        the ampersand's character code with only one of these glyphs. In GSUB, the 
        indices of the other ampersand glyphs are then referenced by this one index.
        <P>
        The text-processing client uses the GSUB data to manage glyph substitution 
        actions. GSUB identifies the glyphs that are input to and output from each 
        glyph substitution action, specifies how and where the client uses glyph 
        substitutes, and regulates the order of glyph substitution operations. Any 
        number of substitutions can be defined for each script or language system 
        represented in a font.
        <P>The GSUB table supports six types of glyph substitutions that are widely used 
         in international typography:
         <UL>
          <LI>
           A <I>single substitution</I> replaces a single glyph with another single glyph. 
           This is used to render positional glyph variants in Arabic and vertical text in 
           the Far East (see Figure 3).<BR>

           An <I>alternate substitution</I> identifies functionally equivalent but 
           different looking forms of a glyph. These glyphs are often referred to as 
           aesthetic alternatives. For example, a font might have five different glyphs 
           for the ampersand symbol, but one would have a default glyph index in the cmap 
           table. The client could use the default glyph or substitute any of the four 
           alternatives (see Figure 5).<BR>

           sequences and one or more substitutions to be performed on that sequence.

           sequence to a 'backtrack' and/or 'lookahead' sequence. Each such substitution 
           can be applied in three formats to handle glyphs, glyph classes or glyph sets

        <P>This organization helps text-processing clients to easily locate the features 
         and lookups that apply to a particular script or language system. To access 
         GSUB information, clients should use the following procedure:
         <OL>
          <LI>
          Locate the current script in the GSUB ScriptList table.
          <LI>
          If the language system is known, search the script for the correct LangSys 
          table; otherwise, use the script's default language system (DefaultLangSys 
          table).
          <LI>
          The LangSys table provides index numbers into the GSUB FeatureList table to 
          access a required feature and a number of additional features.
          <LI>
          Inspect the FeatureTag of each feature, and select the features to apply to an 
          input glyph string. Each feature provides an array of index numbers into the 
          GSUB LookupList table.
          <LI>

        <P>
        Each LookupType subtable has one or more formats. The "best" format depends on 
        the type of substitution and the resulting storage efficiency. When glyph 
        information is best presented in more than one format, a single lookup may 
        define more than one subtable, as long as all the subtables are for the same 
        LookupType. For example, within a given lookup, a glyph index array format may 
        best represent one set of target glyphs, whereas a glyph index range format may 
        be better for another set.
        <P>
        A series of substitution operations on the same glyph or string requires 
        multiple lookups, one for each separate action. Each lookup is given a 
        different array number in the LookupList table and is applied in the LookupList 
        order.
        <P>
        During text processing, a client applies a lookup to each glyph in the string 
        before moving to the next lookup. A lookup is finished for a glyph after the 
        client locates the target glyph or glyph context and performs a substitution, 
        if specified. To move to the "next" glyph, the client will typically skip all 
        the glyphs that participated in the lookup operation: glyphs that were 
        substituted as well as any other glyphs that formed a context for the 
        operation.
        <P>
        In the case of chained contextual lookups, glyphs comprising backtrack and 
        lookahead sequences may participate in more than one context.
        <P>The rest of this chapter describes the GSUB header and the subtables defined 
         for each GSUB LookupType. Examples at the end of this page illustrate each of 
         the five LookupTypes, including the three formats available for contextual

        <P>
        Single substitution (SingleSubst) subtables tell a client to replace a single 
        glyph with another glyph. The subtables can be either of two formats. Both 
        formats require two distinct sets of glyph indices: one that defines input 
        glyphs (specified in the Coverage table), and one that defines the output 
        glyphs. Format 1 requires less space than Format 2, but it is less flexible.
        <P><A NAME="SSF1"><BR>
          <B>Single Substitution Format 1</B></A>
        <P>
        Format 1 calculates the indices of the output glyphs, which are not explicitly 
        defined in the subtable. To calculate an output glyph index, Format 1 adds a 
        constant delta value to the input glyph index. For the substitutions to occur 
        properly, the glyph indices in the input and output ranges must be in the same 
        order. This format does not use the Coverage Index that is returned from the 
        Coverage table.
        <P>The SingleSubstFormat1 subtable begins with a format identifier (SubstFormat) 
         of 1. An offset references a Coverage table that specifies the indices of the 
         input glyphs. DeltaGlyphID is the constant value added to each input glyph 
         index to calculate the index of the corresponding output glyph. <A HREF="#EX2">

          Example 2</A>

        <P>
        A Multiple Substitution (MultipleSubst) subtable replaces a single glyph with 
        more than one glyph, as when multiple glyphs replace a single ligature. The 
        subtable has a single format: MultipleSubstFormat1. The subtable specifies a 
        format identifier (SubstFormat), an offset to a Coverage table that defines the 
        input glyph indices, a count of offsets in the Sequence array (SequenceCount), 
        and an array of offsets to Sequence tables that define the output glyph indices 
        (Sequence). The Sequence table offsets are ordered by the Coverage Index of the 
        input glyphs.
        <P>For each input glyph listed in the Coverage table, a Sequence table defines 
         the output glyphs. Each Sequence table contains a count of the glyphs in the 
         output glyph sequence (GlyphCount) and an array of output glyph indices 
         (Substitute). <BLOCKQUOTE> <I>Note:</I> The order of the output glyph indices 
          depends on the writing direction of the text. For text written left to right, 
          the left-most glyph will be first glyph in the sequence. Conversely, for text 
          written right to left, the right-most glyph will be first. </BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>The use of multiple substitution for deletion of an input glyph is 
         prohibited. GlyphCount should always be greater than 0. <A HREF="#EX4">

        <P>
        An Alternate Substitution (AlternateSubst) subtable identifies any number of 
        aesthetic alternatives from which a user can choose a glyph variant to replace 
        the input glyph. For example, if a font contains four variants of the ampersand 
        symbol, the cmap table will specify the index of one of the four glyphs as the 
        default glyph index, and an AlternateSubst subtable will list the indices of 
        the other three glyphs as alternatives. A text-processing client would then 
        have the option of replacing the default glyph with any of the three 
        alternatives.
        <P>
        The subtable has one format: AlternateSubstFormat1. The subtable contains a 
        format identifier (SubstFormat), an offset to a Coverage table containing the 
        indices of glyphs with alternative forms (Coverage), a count of offsets to 
        AlternateSet tables (AlternateSetCount), and an array of offsets to 
        AlternateSet tables (AlternateSet).
        <P>For each glyph, an AlternateSet subtable contains a count of the alternative 
         glyphs (GlyphCount) and an array of their glyph indices (Alternate). Because

        A LigatureSet table, one for each covered glyph, specifies all the ligature 
        strings that begin with the covered glyph. For example, if the Coverage table 
        lists the glyph index for a lowercase "f," then a LigatureSet table will define 
        the "ffl," "fl," "ffi," "fi," and "ff" ligatures. If the Coverage table also 
        lists the glyph index for a lowercase "e," then a different LigatureSet table 
        will define the "etc" ligature.
        <P>
        A LigatureSet table consists of a count of the ligatures that begin with the 
        covered glyph (LigatureCount) and an array of offsets to Ligature tables, which 
        define the glyphs in each ligature (Ligature). The order in the Ligature offset 
        array defines the preference for using the ligatures. For example, if the "ffl" 
        ligature is preferable to the "ff" ligature, then the Ligature array would list 
        the offset to the "ffl" Ligature table before the offset to the "ff" Ligature

        <P>
        A Contextual Substitution (ContextSubst) subtable defines the most powerful 
        type of glyph substitution lookup: it describes glyph substitutions in context 
        that replace one or more glyphs within a certain pattern of glyphs.
        <P>
        ContextSubst subtables can be any of three formats that define a context in 
        terms of a specific sequence of glyphs, glyph classes, or glyph sets. Each 
        format can describe one or more input glyph sequences and one or more 
        substitutions for each sequence.
        <P>
        All three formats of ContextSubst subtables specify substitution data in a 
        SubstLookupRecord. A description of that record follows.

         </TABLE>
        <P>The SequenceIndex in a SubstLookupRecord must take into consideration the 
         order in which lookups are applied to the entire glyph sequence. Because 
         multiple substitutions may occur per context, the SequenceIndex and 
         LookupListIndex refer to the glyph sequence after the text-processing client 
         has applied any previous lookups. In other words, the SequenceIndex identifies 
         the location for the substitution at the time that the lookup is to be applied. 
         For example, consider an input glyph sequence of four glyphs. The first glyph 
         does not have a substitute, but the middle two glyphs will be replaced with a 
         ligature, and a single glyph will replace the fourth glyph:
         <UL>
          <LI>
          The first glyph is in position 0. No lookups will be applied at position 0, so 
          no SubstLookupRecord is defined.
          <LI>
          The SubstLookupRecord defined for the ligature substitution specifies the 
          SequenceIndex as position 1, which is the position of the first-glyph component 
          in the ligature string. After the ligature replaces the glyphs in positions 1 
          and 2, however, the input glyph sequence consists of only three glyphs, not the 
          original four.
          <LI>
           To replace the last glyph in the sequence, the SubstLookupRecord defines the 
           SequenceIndex as position 2 instead of position 3. This position reflects the 
           effect of the ligature substitution applied before this single substitution.</LI>
         </UL>
         <BLOCKQUOTE> <I>Note:</I> This example assumes that the LookupList specifies the 
          ligature substitution lookup before the single substitution lookup. </BLOCKQUOTE>
         <A NAME="CSF1">
          <P><BR>
           <B>Context Substitution Format 1</B>
         </A>
        <P>
        Format 1 defines the context for a glyph substitution as a particular sequence 
        of glyphs. For example, a context could be &lt;xyz&gt;, &lt;holiday&gt;, 
        &lt;!?*#@&gt;, or any other glyph sequence.
        <P>
        Within a context sequence, Format 1 identifies particular glyph positions (not 
        glyph indices) as the targets for specific substitutions. When a 
        text-processing client locates a context in a string of text, it finds the 
        lookup data for a targeted position and makes a substitution by applying the 
        lookup data at that location.
        <P>
        For example, if a client is to replace the glyph string &lt;abc&gt; with its 
        reverse glyph string &lt;cba&gt;, the input context is defined as the glyph 
        sequence, &lt;abc&gt;, and the lookups defined for the context are (1) "a" to 
        "c" and (2) "c" to "a". When a client encounters the context &lt;abc&gt;, the 
        lookups are performed in the order stored. First, "c" is substituted for "a" 
        resulting in &lt;cbc&gt;. Second, "a" is substituted for the "c" that has not 
        yet been touched, resulting in &lt;cba&gt;.
        <P>
        To specify a context, a Coverage table lists the first glyph in the sequence, 
        and a SubRule table identifies the remaining glyphs. To describe the 
        &gt;abc&lt; context used in the previous example, the Coverage table lists the 
        glyph index of the first component of the sequence-the "a" glyph. A SubRule 
        table defines indices for the "b" and "c" glyphs.
        <P>
        A single ContextSubstFormat1 subtable may define more than one context glyph 
        sequence. If different context sequences begin with the same glyph, then the 
        Coverage table should list the glyph only once because all glyphs in the table 
        must be unique. For example, if three contexts each start with an "s" and two 
        start with a "t," then the Coverage table will list one "s" and one "t."
        <P>
        For each context, a SubRule table lists all the glyphs that follow the first 
        glyph. The table also contains an array of SubstLookupRecords that specify the 
        substitution lookup data for each glyph position (including the first glyph 
        position) in the context.
        <P>
        All of the SubRule tables defining contexts that begin with the same first 
        glyph are grouped together and defined in a SubRuleSet table. For example, the 
        SubRule tables that define the three contexts that begin with an "s" are 
        grouped in one SubRuleSet table, and the SubRule tables that define the two 
        contexts that begin with a "t" are grouped in a second SubRuleSet table. Each 
        glyph listed in the Coverage table must have a SubRuleSet table defining all 
        the SubRule tables that apply to a covered glyph.
        <P>
        To locate a context glyph sequence, the text-processing client searches the 
        Coverage table each time it encounters a new text glyph. If the glyph is 
        covered, the client reads the corresponding SubRuleSet table and examines each 
        SubRule table in the set to determine whether the rest of the context matches 
        the subsequent glyphs in the text. If the context and text string match, the 
        client finds the target glyph positions, applies the lookups for those 
        positions, and completes the substitutions.
        <P>
        A ContextSubstFormat1 subtable contains a format identifier (SubstFormat), an 
        offset to a Coverage table (Coverage), a count of defined SubRuleSets 
        (SubRuleSetCount), and an array of offsets to the SubRuleSet tables 
        (SubRuleSet). As mentioned, one SubRuleSet table must be defined for each glyph 
        listed in the Coverage table.
        <P>
        In the SubRuleSet array, the SubRuleSet table offsets are ordered in the 
        Coverage Index order. The first SubRuleSet in the array applies to the first 
        GlyphID listed in the Coverage table, the second SubRuleSet in the array 
        applies to the second GlyphID listed in the Coverage table, and so on.

          Example 7</A> at the end of the chapter shows how to use the 
         ContextSubstFormat1 subtable to replace a sequence of three glyphs with a 
         sequence preferred for the French language system. <A NAME="CSF2">
          <P><BR>
           <B>Context Substitution Format 2</B>
         </A>
        <P>
        Format 2, a more flexible format than Format 1, describes class-based context 
        substitution. For this format, a specific integer, called a class value, must 
        be assigned to each glyph component in all context glyph sequences. Contexts 
        are then defined as sequences of glyph class values. More than one context may 
        be defined at a time.
        <P>
        For example, suppose that a swash capital glyph should replace each uppercase 
        letter glyph that is preceded by a space glyph and followed by a lowercase 
        letter glyph (a glyph sequence of space - uppercase - lowercase). The set of 
        uppercase glyphs would constitute one glyph class (Class 1), the set of 
        lowercase glyphs would constitute a second class (Class 2), and the space glyph 
        would constitute a third class (Class 3). The input context might be specified 
        with a context rule (called a SubClassRule) that describes "the set of glyph 
        strings that form a sequence of three glyph classes, one glyph from Class 3, 
        followed by one glyph from Class 1, followed by one glyph from Class 2."
        <P>
        Each ContextSubstFormat2 subtable contains an offset to a class definition 
        table (ClassDef), which defines the glyph class values of all input contexts. 
        Generally, a unique ClassDef table will be declared in each instance of the 
        ContextSubstFormat2 table that is included in a font, even though several 
        Format 2 tables could share ClassDef tables. Class assignments are fixed (the 
        same for each position in the context), and classes are exclusive (a glyph 
        cannot be in more than one class at a time). The output glyphs that replace the 
        glyphs in the context sequences do not need class values because they are 
        specified elsewhere by GlyphID.
        <P>
        The ContextSubstFormat2 subtable also contains a format identifier 
        (SubstFormat) and defines an offset to a Coverage table (Coverage). For this 
        format, the Coverage table lists indices for the complete set of unique glyphs 
        (not glyph classes) that may appear as the first glyph of any class-based 
        context. In other words, the Coverage table contains the list of glyph indices 
        for all the glyphs in all classes that may be first in any of the context class 
        sequences. For example, if the contexts begin with a Class 1 or Class 2 glyph, 
        then the Coverage table will list the indices of all Class 1 and Class 2 
        glyphs.
        <P>
        A ContextSubstFormat2 subtable also defines an array of offsets to the 
        SubClassSet tables (SubClassSet) and a count of the SubClassSet tables 
        (SubClassSetCnt). The array contains one offset for each class (including Class 
        0) in the ClassDef table. In the array, the class value defines an offset's 
        index position, and the SubClassSet offsets are ordered by ascending class 
        value (from 0 to SubClassSetCnt - 1).
        <P>
        For example, the first SubClassSet listed in the array contains all contexts 
        beginning with Class 0 glyphs, the second SubClassSet contains all contexts 
        beginning with Class 1 glyphs, and so on. If no contexts begin with a 
        particular class (that is, if a SubClassSet contains no SubClassRule tables), 
        then the offset to that particular SubClassSet in the SubClassSet array will be 
        set to NULL.

        <P>For each context, a SubClassRule table contains a count of the glyph classes 
         in the context sequence (GlyphCount), including the first class. A Class array 
         lists the classes, beginning with the second class (array index = 1), that 
         follow the first class in the context. <BLOCKQUOTE> <I>Note:</I> Text order

        <P>
        The values specified in the Class array are the values defined in the ClassDef 
        table. For example, a context consisting of the sequence "Class 2, Class 7, 
        Class 5, Class 0" will produce a Class array of 7,5,0. The first class in the 
        sequence, Class 2, is identified in the ContextSubstFormat2 table by the 
        SubClassSet array index of the corresponding SubClassSet.
        <P>
        A SubClassRule also contains a count of the substitutions to be performed on 
        the context (SubstCount) and an array of SubstLookupRecords (SubstLookupRecord) 
        that supply the substitution data. For each position in the context that 
        requires a substitution, a SubstLookupRecord specifies a LookupList index and a 
        position in the input glyph sequence where the lookup is applied. The 
        SubstLookupRecord array lists SubstLookupRecords in design order-that is, the 
        order in which lookups should be applied to the entire glyph sequence.

         </A>
        <P>
        Format 3, coverage-based context substitution, defines a context rule as a 
        sequence of coverage tables. Each position in the sequence may define a 
        different Coverage table for the set of glyphs that matches the context 
        pattern. With Format 3, the glyph sets defined in the different Coverage tables 
        may intersect, unlike Format 2 which specifies fixed class assignments 
        (identical for each position in the context sequence) and exclusive classes (a 
        glyph cannot be in more than one class at a time).
        <P>For example, consider an input context that contains a lowercase glyph 
         (position 0), followed by an uppercase glyph (position 1), either a lowercase 
         or numeral glyph (position 2), and then either a lowercase or uppercase vowel 
         (position 3). This context requires four Coverage tables, one for each 
         position:
         <UL>
          <LI>
          In position 0, the Coverage table lists the set of lowercase glyphs.
          <LI>
          In position 1, the Coverage table lists the set of uppercase glyphs.
          <LI>
          In position 2, the Coverage table lists the set of lowercase and numeral 
          glyphs, a superset of the glyphs defined in the Coverage table for position 0.
          <LI>
           In position 3, the Coverage table lists the set of lowercase and uppercase 
           vowels, a subset of the glyphs defined in the Coverage tables for both 
           positions 0 and 1.</LI>
         </UL>
        <P>Unlike Formats 1 and 2, this format defines only one context rule at a time. 
         It consists of a format identifier (SubstFormat), a count of the glyphs in the 
         sequence to be matched (GlyphCount), and an array of Coverage offsets that 
         describe the input context sequence (Coverage). <BLOCKQUOTE><I>Note:</I> The 
          order of the Coverage tables listed in the Coverage array must follow the

          <B>LookupType 6: Chaining Contextual Substitution Subtable</B></A>
        <P>A Chaining Contextual Substitution subtable (ChainContextSubst) describes 
         glyph substitutions in context with an ability to look back and/or look ahead 
         in the sequence of glyphs. The design of the Chaining Contextual Substitution 
         subtable is parallel to that of the Contextual Substitution subtable, including 
         the availability of three formats for handling sequences of glyphs, glyph 
         classes, or glyph sets. Each format can describe one or more backtrack, input, 
         and lookahead sequences and one or more substitutions for each sequence. <A NAME="CSF1">
          <P><BR>
           <B>Chaining Context Substitution Format 1: Simple Chaining Context Glyph 
            Substitution</B>
         </A>
        <P>
        Format 1 defines the context for a glyph substitution as a particular sequence 
        of glyphs. For example, a context could be &lt;xyz&gt;, &lt;holiday&gt;, 
        &lt;!?*#@&gt;, or any other glyph sequence.
        <P>
        Within a context sequence, Format 1 identifies particular glyph positions (not 
        glyph indices) as the targets for specific substitutions. When a 
        text-processing client locates a context in a string of text, it finds the 
        lookup data for a targeted position and makes a substitution by applying the 
        lookup data at that location.
        <P>To specify the context, the coverage table lists the first glyph in the input 
         sequence, and the ChainSubRule subtable defines the rest. Once a covered glyph 
         is found at position <I>i</I>, the client reads the corresponding 
         ChainSubRuleSet table and examines each table to determine if it matches the 
         surrounding glyphs in the text. In the simplest of cases, there is a match if 
         the string &lt;backtrack sequence&gt;+&lt;input sequence&gt;+&lt;lookahead 
         sequence&gt; matches with the glyphs at position <I>i - BacktrackGlyphCount</I>
        in the text. LookupFlag values affect backtrack/lookahead sequences.
        <P>To clarify the ordering of glyph arrays for input, backtrack and lookahead sequences, the following illustration is provided. Input sequence match begins at <i>i</i> where the input sequence match begins. The backtrack sequence is ordered beginning at <i>i</i> - 1 and increases in offset value as one moves away from <i>i</i>. The lookahead sequence begins after the input sequence and increases in logical order.

        <P>

        If there is a match, then the client finds the target glyph positions for 
        substitutions and completes the substitutions. Please note that (just like in 
        the ContextSubstFormat1 subtable) these lookups are required to operate within 
        the range of text from the covered glyph to the end of the input sequence. No 
        substitutions can be defined for the backtracking sequence or the lookahead 
        sequence.
        <P>Once the substitutions are complete, the client should move to the glyph 
         position <I>immediately following the matched input sequence</I>
        and resume the lookup process from there.
        <P>
        A single ChainContextSubstFormat1 subtable may define more than one context 
        glyph sequence. If different context sequences begin with the same glyph, then 
        the Coverage table should list the glyph only once because all glyphs in the 
        table must be unique. For example, if three contexts each start with an "s" and 
        two start with a "t," then the Coverage table will list one "s" and one "t."
        <P>
        All of the ChainSubRule tables defining contexts that begin with the same first 
        glyph are grouped together and defined in a ChainSubRuleSet table. For example, 
        the ChainSubRule tables that define the three contexts that begin with an "s" 
        are grouped in one ChainSubRuleSet table, and the ChainSubRule tables that 
        define the two contexts that begin with a "t" are grouped in a second 
        ChainSubRuleSet table. Each glyph listed in the Coverage table must have a 
        ChainSubRuleSet table defining all the ChainSubRule tables that apply to a 
        covered glyph.
        <P>
        A ChainContextSubstFormat1 subtable contains a format identifier (SubstFormat), 
        an offset to a Coverage table (Coverage), a count of defined ChainSubRuleSets 
        (ChainSubRuleSetCount), and an array of offsets to the ChainSubRuleSet tables 
        (ChainSubRuleSet). As mentioned, one ChainSubRuleSet table must be defined for 
        each glyph listed in the Coverage table.
        <P>
        In the ChainSubRuleSet array, the ChainSubRuleSet table offsets are ordered in 
        the Coverage Index order. The first ChainSubRuleSet in the array applies to the 
        first GlyphID listed in the Coverage table, the second ChainSubRuleSet in the 
        array applies to the second GlyphID listed in the Coverage table, and so on.

        A ChainSubRuleSet table consists of an array of offsets to ChainSubRule tables 
        (ChainSubRule), ordered by preference, and a count of the ChainSubRule tables 
        defined in the set (ChainSubRuleCount).
        <P>
        The order in the ChainSubRule array can be critical. Consider two contexts, 
        &lt;abc&gt; and &lt;abcd&gt;. If &lt;abc&gt; is first in the ChainSubRule 
        array, all instances of &lt;abc&gt; in the text-including all instances of 
        &lt;abcd&gt;-will be changed. If &lt;abcd&gt; comes first in the array, 
        however, only &lt;abcd&gt; sequences will be changed, without affecting any 
        instances of &lt;abc&gt;.

           <B>Chaining Context Substitution Format 2: Class-based Chaining Context Glyph 
            Substitution</B>
         </A>
        <P>
        Format 2 describes class-based chaining context substitution. For this format, 
        a specific integer, called a class value, must be assigned to each glyph 
        component in all context glyph sequences. Contexts are then defined as 
        sequences of glyph class values. More than one context may be defined at a 
        time.
        <P>
        To chain contexts, three classes are used in the glyph ClassDef table: 
        Backtrack ClassDef, Input ClassDef, and Lookahead ClassDef.
        <P>
        The ChainContextSubstFormat2 subtable also contains a format identifier 
        (SubstFormat) and defines an offset to a Coverage table (Coverage). For this 
        format, the Coverage table lists indices for the complete set of unique glyphs 
        (not glyph classes) that may appear as the first glyph of any class-based 
        context. In other words, the Coverage table contains the list of glyph indices 
        for all the glyphs in all classes that may be first in any of the context class 
        sequences. For example, if the contexts begin with a Class 1 or Class 2 glyph, 
        then the Coverage table will list the indices of all Class 1 and Class 2 
        glyphs.
        <P>
        A ChainContextSubstFormat2 subtable also defines an array of offsets to the 
        ChainSubClassSet tables (ChainSubClassSet) and a count of the ChainSubClassSet 
        tables (ChainSubClassSetCnt). The array contains one offset for each class 
        (including Class 0) in the ClassDef table. In the array, the class value 
        defines an offset's index position, and the ChainSubClassSet offsets are 
        ordered by ascending class value (from 0 to ChainSubClassSetCnt - 1).
        <P>
        If no contexts begin with a particular class (that is, if a ChainSubClassSet 
        contains no ChainSubClassRule tables), then the offset to that particular 
        ChainSubClassSet in the ChainSubClassSet array will be set to NULL.

         <B>Substitution Lookup Record</B>
        <P>
        All contextual substitution subtables specify the substitution data in a 
        Substitution Lookup Record (SubstLookupRecord). Each record contains a 
        SequenceIndex, which indicates the position where the substitution will occur 
        in the glyph sequence. In addition, a LookupListIndex identifies the lookup to 
        be applied at the glyph position specified by the SequenceIndex.
        <P>
        The contextual substitution subtables defined in Examples 7, 8, and 9 at the 
        end of this chapter show SubstLookupRecords.
        <P><A name="RCCS"><B>LookupType 8:&nbsp;Reverse Chaining Contextual Single 
           Substitution Subtable</B></A>
        <P>
        Reverse Chaining Contextual Single Substitution&nbsp; subtable 
        (ReverseChainSingleSubst) describes single glyph substitutions in context with 
        an ability to look back and/or look ahead in the sequence of glyphs. The major 
        difference between this and other lookup types is that processing of input 
        glyph sequence goes from end to start. Comparing to Chaining Contextual 
        Sustitution this format is restricted to only coverage based subtable format, 
        input sequence could contain only single glyph and only single substitution 
        allowed on this glyph. This substitution rule is integrated into subtable 
        format.
        <P>This lookup type is designed specifically for the Arabic script writing 
         styles, like nastaliq, where the shape of the glyph is determined by the 
         following glyph, beginning at the last glyph of the "joor", or set of connected 
         glyphs. An example of this lookup type is defined in <A HREF="#EX10">Example 10</A>
        at the end of this chapter.

        <P><B>Reverse Chaining Contextual Single Substitution&nbsp;&nbsp;Format 1: 
          Coverage Based Reverse Chaining Contextual Single Glyph Substitution.</B>
        <P>Format 1 defines a chaining context rule as a sequence of Coverage tables. 
         Each position in the sequence may define a different Coverage table for the set 
         of glyphs that matches the context pattern. With Format 1, the glyph sets 
         defined in the different Coverage tables may intersect. <BLOCKQUOTE><B><I>Note:</I></B> 
          Despite&nbsp;reverse order processing, the order of the Coverage tables listed 
          in the Coverage array must be in logical order (follow the writing direction). 
          The backtrack sequence is as illustrated in the LookupType 6: 
          Chaining Contextual Substitution subtable. The input sequence is one glyph located
          at <i>i</i> in the logical string. The backtrack begins at <i>i</i> - 1 and increases
          in offset value as one moves toward the logical beginning of the string. The lookahead
          sequence begins at <i>i</i> + 1 and increases in offset value as one moves toward
          the logical end of the string. In the reverse chaining process <i>i</i> began at the logical
          end of the string and moves to the beginning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
        <P>
        The subtable&nbsp;contains Coverage table for input glyph and Coverage table 
        arrays for lookahead and backtrack sequences, also count of output glyph 
        indices in the Substitute array (GlyphCount), and a list of the output glyph 
        indices (Substitute array). The Substitute array must contain the same number 
        of glyph indices as the Coverage table. To locate the corresponding output 
        glyph index in the Substitute array, this format uses the Coverage Index 
        returned from the Coverage table.

        , which uses ranges to replace single input glyphs with their corresponding 
        output glyphs. The indices of the output glyphs are calculated by adding a 
        constant delta value to the indices of the input glyphs. In this example, the 
        Coverage table has a format identifier of 1 to indicate the range format, which 
        is used because the input glyph indices are in consecutive order in the font. 
        The Coverage table specifies one range that contains a StartGlyphID for the "0" 
        (zero) glyph and an EndGlyphID for the "9" glyph.

        <P>Example 5 uses the <A HREF="#ASF1">AlternateSubstFormat1 subtable</A>
        to replace the default ampersand glyph (input glyph) with one of two 
        alternative ampersand glyphs (output glyph).
        <P>
        In this case, the Coverage table specifies the index of a single glyph, the 
        default ampersand, because it is the only glyph covered by this lookup. The 
        AlternateSet table for this covered glyph identifies the alternative glyphs: 
        AltAmpersand1GlyphID and AltAmpersand2GlyphID.
        <P>
        In Example 5, the index position of the AlternateSet table offset in the 
        AlternateSet array is zero (0), which correlates with the index position (also 
        zero) of the default ampersand glyph in the Coverage table.

           <B>Example 6: LigatureSubstFormat1 Subtable</B>
         </A>
        <P>Example 6 shows a <A HREF="#LSF1">LigatureSubstFormat1 subtable</A>
        that defines data to replace a string of glyphs with a single ligature glyph. 
        Because a LigatureSubstFormat1 subtable can specify glyph substitutions for 
        more than one ligature, this subtable defines three ligatures: "etc," "ffi," 
        and "fi."
        <P>
        The sample subtable contains a format identifier (4) and an offset to a 
        Coverage table. The Coverage table, which lists an index for each first glyph 
        in the ligatures, lists indices for the "e" and "f" glyphs. The Coverage table 
        range format is used here because the "e" and "f" glyph indices are numbered 
        consecutively.
        <P>
        In the LigatureSubst subtable, LigSetCount specifies two LigatureSet tables, 
        one for each covered glyph, and the LigatureSet array stores offsets to them. 
        In this array, the "e" LigatureSet precedes the "f" LigatureSet, matching the 
        order of the corresponding first-glyph components in the Coverage table.
        <P>
        Each LigatureSet table identifies all ligatures that begin with a covered 
        glyph. The sample LigatureSet table defined for the "e" glyph contains only one 
        ligature, "etc." A LigatureSet table defined for the "f" glyph contains two 
        ligatures, "ffi" and "fi."
        <P>
        The sample FLigaturesSet table has offsets to two Ligature tables, one for 
        "ffi" and one for "fi." The Ligature array lists the "ffi" Ligature table first 
        to indicate that the "ffi" ligature is preferred to the "fi" ligature.

          <P><BR>
           <B>Example 7: ContextSubstFormat1 Subtable and SubstLookupRecord</B>
         </A>
        <P>Example 7 uses a <A HREF="#CSF1">ContextSubstFormat1 subtable</A>
        for glyph sequences to replace a string of three glyphs with another string. 
        For the French language system, the subtable defines a contextual substitution 
        that replaces the input sequence, space-dash-space, with the output sequence, 
        thin space-dash-thin space.
        <P>
        The contextual substitution, called Dash Lookup in this example, contains one 
        ContextSubstFormat1 subtable called the DashSubtable. The subtable specifies 
        two contexts: a SpaceGlyph followed by a DashGlyph, and a DashGlyph followed by 
        a SpaceGlyph. In each sequence, a single substitution replaces the SpaceGlyph 
        with a ThinSpaceGlyph.
        <P>
        The Coverage table, labeled DashCoverage, lists two GlyphIDs for the first 
        glyphs in the SpaceGlyph and DashGlyph sequences. One SubRuleSet table is 
        defined for each covered glyph.
        <P>
        SpaceAndDashSubRuleSet lists all the contexts that begin with a SpaceGlyph. It 
        contains an offset to one SubRule table (SpaceAndDashSubRule), which specifies 
        two glyphs in the context sequence, the second of which is a DashGlyph. The 
        SubRule table contains an offset to a SubstLookupRecord that lists the position 
        in the sequence where the glyph substitution should occur (position 0) and the 
        index of the SpaceToThinSpaceLookup applied there to replace the SpaceGlyph 
        with a ThinSpaceGlyph. DashAndSpaceSubRuleSet lists all the contexts that begin 
        with a DashGlyph. An offset to a SubRule table (DashAndSpaceSubRule) specifies 
        two glyphs in the context sequence, and the second one is a SpaceGlyph. The 
        SubRule table contains an offset to a SubstLookupRecord, which lists the 
        position in the sequence where the glyph substitution should occur, and an 
        index to the same lookup used in the SpaceAndDashSubRule. The lookup replaces 
        the SpaceGlyph with a ThinSpaceGlyph.

           <B>Example 8: ContextSubstFormat2 Subtable</B>
         </A>
        <P>Example 8 uses a <A HREF="#CSF2">ContextSubstFormat2 subtable</A>
        with glyph classes to replace default mark glyphs with their alternative forms. 
        Glyph alternatives are selected depending upon the height of the base glyph 
        that they combine with-that is, the mark glyph used above a high base glyph 
        differs from the mark glyph above a very high base glyph.
        <P>
        In the example, SetMarksHighSubtable contains a Class table that defines four 
        glyph classes: medium-height glyphs (Class 0), all default mark glyphs (Class 
        1), high glyphs (Class 2), and very high glyphs (Class 3). The subtable also 
        contains a Coverage table that lists each base glyph that functions as a first 
        component in a context, ordered by glyph index.

        Two SubClassSets are defined, one for substituting high marks and one for very 
        high marks. No SubClassSets are specified for Class 0 and Class 1 glyphs 
        because no contexts begin with glyphs from these classes. The SubClassSet array 
        lists SubClassSets in numerical order, so SubClassSet 2 precedes SubClassSet 3.
        <P>
        Within each SubClassSet, a SubClassRule is defined. In 
        SetMarksHighSubClassSet2, the SubClassRule table specifies two glyphs in the 
        context, the first glyph in Class 2 (a high glyph) and the second in Class 1 (a 
        mark glyph). The SubstLookupRecord specifies applying SubstituteHighMarkLookup 
        at the second position in the sequence-that is, a high mark glyph will replace 
        the default mark glyph.
        <P>
        In SetMarksVeryHighSubClassSet3, the SubClassRule specifies two glyphs in the 
        context, the first in Class 3 (a very high glyph) and the second in Class 1 (a 
        mark glyph). The SubstLookupRecord specifies applying 
        SubstituteVeryHighMarkLookup at the second position in the sequence-that is, a 
        very high mark glyph will replace the default mark glyph.

           <B>Example 9: ContextualSubstFormat3 Subtable</B>
         </A>
        <P>Example 9 uses the <A HREF="#CSF3">ContextSubstFormat3 subtable</A>
        with Coverage tables to describe a context sequence of three lowercase glyphs 
        in the pattern: any ascender or descender glyph in position 0 (zero), any 
        x-height glyph in position 1, and any descender glyph in position 2. The 
        overlapping sets of covered glyphs for positions 0 and 2 make Format 3 better 
        for this context than the class-based Format 2.
        <P>
        In positions 0 and 2, swash versions of the glyphs replace the default glyphs. 
        The contextual-substitution lookup is SwashLookup (LookupList index = 0), and 
        its subtable is SwashSubtable. The SwashSubtable defines three Coverage tables: 
        AscenderDescenderCoverage, XheightCoverage, and DescenderCoverage-one for each 
        glyph position in the context sequence, respectively.
        <P>
        The SwashSubtable also defines two SubstLookupRecords: one that applies to 
        position 0, and one for position 2. (No substitutions are applied to position 
        1.) The record for position 0 uses a single substitution lookup called 
        AscDescSwashLookup to replace the current ascender or descender glyph with a 
        swash ascender or descender glyph. The record for position 2 uses a single 
        substitution lookup called DescSwashLookup to replace the current descender 
        glyph with a swash descender glyph.

        <P>Example 10 uses a <A HREF="#RCSSF1">ReverseChainSingleSubstFormat1 subtable</A>
        for glyph sequences to glyph with the correct form that has a thick connection 
        to the left (thick exit). This allow the glyph to correctly connect to the 
        letter form to the left of it.
        <P>
        The ThickExitCoverage table is the listing of glyphs to be matched for 
        substitution.
        <P>
        The LookaheadCoverage table, labeled ThickEntryCoverage, lists four GlyphIDs 
        for the glyph following a substitution coverage glyph. This lookahead coverage 
        attempts to match the context that will cause the substitution to take place.
        <P>
        The Substitute table maps the glyphs to replace those in the 
        ThickConnectCoverage table.
