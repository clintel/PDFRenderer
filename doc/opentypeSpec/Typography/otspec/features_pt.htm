       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Proportional Alternate Widths</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe</p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>Respaces glyphs designed to be set on full-em widths, 
        fitting them onto individual (more or less proportional) horizontal widths. 
        This differs from pwid in that it does not substitute new glyphs (GPOS, not 
        GSUB feature). The user may prefer the monospaced form, or may simply want to 
        ensure that the glyph is well-fit and not rotated in vertical setting (Latin 
        forms designed for proportional spacing would be rotated).</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user may invoke this feature in a Japanese font to get 
        Latin, Kanji, Kana or Symbol glyphs with the full-width design but individual 
        metrics.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The font specifies alternate metrics for 
        the full-width glyphs (GPOS lookup type 1).</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the palt coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the table and gets back positional adjustments 
        (XPlacement, XAdvance, YPlacement and YAdvance).</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature would be off by default.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>Used mostly in CJKV fonts.</p>

       <P><I>Registered by: </I>Tiro Typeworks / Emigre</P>
       <P><I>Function: </I>Some fonts contain an additional size of capital letters, 
        shorter than the regular smallcaps and whimsically referred to as petite caps. 
        Such forms are most likely to be found in designs with a small lowercase 
        x-height, where they better harmonise with lowercase text than the taller 
        smallcaps (for examples of petite caps, see the Emigre type families Mrs Eaves 
        and Filosofia). This feature turns lowercase characters into petite capitals. 
        Forms related to petite capitals, such as specially designed figures, may be 
        included.</P>
       <P><IMG SRC="pcapprop.gif" WIDTH="422" HEIGHt="68" ALT="pcap proposal illustration"></P>
       <P><I>Example: </I>The user enters text as lowercase or mixed case, and gets 
        petite cap text or text with regular uppercase and petite caps. Note that some 
        designers, might extend the petite cap lookups to include uppercase-to-smallcap 
        substitutions, creating a shifting hierarchy of uppercase forms.</P>
       <P><I>Recommended implementation: </I>The pcap table maps lowercase glyphs to 
        the corresponding petite cap forms (GSUB lookup type 1).</P>
       <P><I>Application interface: </I>For GIDs found in the pcap coverage table, the 
        application passes GIDs to the pcap table, and gets back new GIDs. Petite cap 
        substitutions should follow language rules for smallcap (<a href="#smcp">smcp</a>)

       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Proportional Figures</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Microsoft/Adobe</p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>Replaces figure glyphs set on uniform (tabular) widths with 
        corresponding glyphs set on glyph-specific (proportional) widths. Tabular 
        widths will generally be the default, but this cannot be safely assumed. Of 
        course this feature would not be present in monospaced designs.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user may apply this feature to get even spacing for 
        lining figures used as dates in an all-cap headline.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>In order to simplify associated kerning 
        and get the best glyph design for a given width, this feature should use new 
        glyphs for the figures, rather than only adjusting the fit of the tabular 
        glyphs (although some may be simple copies); i.e. not a GPOS feature. The pnum 
        table maps tabular versions of lining and/or oldstyle figures to corresponding 
        proportional glyphs (GSUB lookup type 1).</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the pnum coverage table, the 
        application passes GIDs to the pnum table and gets back new GIDs.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be off by default. The application

       <P>
        <I>Example: </I>
       In the Gujarati (Indic) script, the doubling of consonant Ka requires the first

       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe
       </p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>A number of Unicode characters are rendered by different shapes depending on the directional context in which they appear. For example, the character U+0028 LEFT PARENTHESIS is interpreted by the Unicode standard as an opening parenthesis and it appears as "(" in left-to-right contexts, and as ")" in right-to-left contexts (this is described on page 66 of the Unicode Standard, version 3.0). The 'rtla' feature is used to access the shape appropriate for a right-to-left context.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The 'rtla' feature replaces the glyph "(" by the glyph ")".</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>These are one-to-one substitutions (GSUB lookup type 1). Since this feature is a glyph selection feature, it should probably be performed early in the shaping process. At least all the glyphs mapped from characters with the mirrored property should have a replacement.
</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>The layout application applies the Unicode bidi algorithm to the character string to display, and maps the resulting character string to glyphs via the cmap. It activates the 'rtla' feature on glyphs that correspond to characters with an odd (right-to-left) resolved level. It is important to note that this feature can be applied to more glyphs than those that correspond to characters with the mirrored property. The motivation is that the font designer may want additional characters to assume different shapes.<p>
If the 'rtla' feature is implemented, it must be implemented for all glyphs in the font that represent Unicode characters with the mirrored property. If the 'rtla' feature is not implemented, it is assumed that the application will take care of bidirectional mirroring through an algorithm.</p>

       <p><i>Function: </i>Japanese typesetting often uses smaller kana glyphs, 
        generally in superscripted form, to clarify the meaning of kanji which may be 
        unfamiliar to the reader. These are called ruby, from the old typesetting term 
        for four-point-sized type. This feature identifies glyphs in the font which 
        have been designed for this use, substituting them for the default designs.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user applies this feature to the kana character U+3042, 
        to get the ruby form for annotation.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The font contains alternate glyphs for all 
        kana characters which are enabled for ruby notation. The ruby table maps GIDs 
        for default forms to GIDs for corresponding ruby alternates. These are 
        one-to-one substitutions (GSUB lookup type 1).</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the ruby coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs for default forms to the table and gets back new 
        GIDs for ruby forms. The application then scales and positions these forms 
        according to its defaults, which may take user parameters.</p>

       <p><i>Function: </i>Many fonts contain alternate glyph designs for a purely 
        esthetic effect; these don't always fit into a clear category like swash or 
        historical. As in the case of swash glyphs, there may be more than one 
        alternate form. This feature replaces the default forms with the stylistic 
        alternates.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user applies this feature to Industria to get the 
        alternate form of g.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The salt table maps GIDs for default forms 
        to one or more GIDs for corresponding stylistic alternatives. While many of 
        these substitutions are one-to-one (GSUB lookup type 1), others require a 
        selection from a set (GSUB lookup type 3). The manufacturer may choose to build 
        two tables (one for each lookup type) or only one which uses lookup type 3 for 
        all substitutions. As in any one-from-many substitution, alternates present in 
        more than one face should be ordered consistently across a family, so that 
        those alternates can work correctly when switching between family members.</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the salt coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the salt table and gets back one or more new 
        GIDs. If more than one GID is returned, the application must provide a means 
        for the user to select the one desired.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be inactive by default. When more 
        than one GID is returned, an application could display the forms sequentially 
        in context, or present a palette showing all the forms at once, or give the 
        user a choice between these approaches. The application may assume that the 
        first glyph in a set is the preferred form, so the font developer should order 
        them accordingly.</p>

       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Optical size</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe</p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>This feature stores two kinds of information about the 
        optical size of the font: design size (the point size for which the font is 
        optimized) and size range (the range of point sizes which the font can serve 
        well), as well as other information which helps applications use the size 
        range. The design size is useful for determining proper tracking behavior. The 
        size range is useful in families which have fonts covering several ranges. 
        Additional values serve to identify the set of fonts which share related size 
        ranges, and to identify their shared name. Note that sizes refer to nominal 
        final output size, and are independent of viewing magnification or resolution.</p>
       <p><i>Required implementation: </i>
       </p>
       <p class="Body">The Feature table of this GPOS feature contains no lookups; its 
        Feature Parameters field records an offset from the beginning of the Feature 
        table to an array of five 16-bit unsigned integer values. The size feature must 
        be implemented in all fonts in any family which uses the feature. In this 
        usage, a family is a set of fonts which share a Preferred Family name (name ID 
        16), or Font Family name (name ID 1) if the Preferred Family name is absent.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        The first value represents the design size in 720/inch units (decipoints). The 
        design size entry must be non-zero. When there is a design size but no 
        recommended size range, the rest of the array will consist of zeros.
        <li>
        The second value has no independent meaning, but serves as an identifier that 
        associates fonts in a subfamily. All fonts which share a Preferred or Font 
        Family name and which differ only by size range shall have the same subfamily 
        value, and no fonts which differ in weight or style shall have the same 
        subfamily value. If this value is zero, the remaining fields in the array will 
        be ignored.
        <li>
        The third value enables applications to use a single name for the subfamily 
        identified by the second value. If the preceding value is non-zero, this value 
        must be set in the range 256 - 32767 (inclusive). It records the value of a 
        field in the name table, which must contain English-language strings encoded in 
        Windows Unicode and Macintosh Roman, and may contain additional strings 
        localized to other scripts and languages. Each of these strings is the name an 
        application should use, in combination with the family name, to represent the 
        subfamily in a menu. Applications will choose the appropriate version based on 
        their selection criteria.
        <li>
        The fourth and fifth values represent the small 
        end of the recommended usage range (exclusive) and the large end of the 
        recommended usage range (inclusive), stored in 720/inch units 
        (decipoints). Ranges must not overlap, and should generally be 
        contiguous.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The size information in Bell Centennial is [60 0 0 0 0]. This 
        tells an application that the fontâs design size is six points, so larger 
        sizes may need proportionate reduction in default inter-glyph spacing. The size 
        information in Minion Pro Semibold Condensed Subhead is [180 3 257 139 240]. 
        These values tell an application that:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        The font's design size is 18 points;
        <li>
        This font is part of a subfamily of fonts that differ only by the size range 
        which each covers, and which share the arbitrary identifier number 3;
        <li>
        ID 257 in the name table is the suggested menu name for this subfamily. In this 
        case, the string at name ID 257 is Semibold Condensed;
        <li>
        This font is the recommended choice from sizes 
        greater than 13.9-point up through 24-points.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>When the user specifies a size, the application 
        checks for a size feature in the active font. If none is found, the application 
        follows its default behavior. If one is found, the application follows the 
        specified offset to retrieve the five values.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <i>Design size: </i>Applications which offer size-based tracking have a 
         pre-defined curve which they can apply. By default, this curve should be set to 
         produce no adjustment at the font's design size (first value in the array, in 
         decipoints).<br>
        <li>
         <i>Size ranges: </i>If the 
        second value in the size array is non-zero, the font has a recommended 
        size range. When any such font is selected by the user, the application 
        builds a list of all fonts with this subfamily value and the same 
        Preferred Family name, and notes the size range in the current font. 
        Applications may want to cache the subfamily list at this point. If the 
        specified size falls in the current font's range, the application uses 
        the current font. If not, the application checks the other ranges in the 
        subfamily, and if the specified size falls in one of them, uses that 
        font. If the specified size is not in any range present, the font with 
        the range closest to the specified value is used. If the specified size 
        falls exactly between two ranges, the range with the larger values is 
        used. Since adding or removing fonts from a subfamily may cause reflow, 
        applications should note which fonts are used for which text.</li>
       </ul>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be active by default. Applications 
        may want to present the tracking curve to the user for adjustments via a GUI. 
        At start-up, and when fonts are added or removed, applications may want to 
        build a list of fonts with such ranges, and display the filtered subfamily 
        names in their font selection UI, with each filtered name representing the full 
        set of related sizes. Applications may also present a setting which allows the 
        user to select non-default sizes (for example, in the case where final output 
        is intended for on-screen viewing, a smaller optical size will produce better 
        results). In such a case, the font-selection UI should present the unfiltered 
        names. Applications should notify the user if fonts are removed or added from a 
        subfamily with size ranges, and query about desired behavior.</p>

Glyphs in stylistic sets may be designed to harmonise visually, interract in particular ways, or otherwise work together. Examples of fonts including stylistic sets are Zapfino Linotype and Adobe's Poetica. Individual features numbered sequentially with the tag name convention 'ss01' 'ss02' 'ss03' . 'ss20' provide a mechanism for glyphs in these sets to be associated via GSUB lookup indexes to default forms and to each other, and for users to select from available stylistic sets.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>An ssXX table maps GIDs for default forms to one GIDs for corresponding stylistic alternatives in each set.

        letters to the corresponding superior forms (GSUB lookup type 1).</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the sups coverage table, the 
        application passes a GID to the feature and gets back a new GID. Note: This can 
        include a change of semantic value. Besides the original character codes, the 
        application should store the code for the new character.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be off by default.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>Can apply to nearly any script.</p>

       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Swash</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Microsoft/Adobe</p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>This feature replaces default character glyphs with 
        corresponding swash glyphs. Note that there may be more than one swash 
        alternate for a given character.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user inputs the ampersand character when setting text 
        with Poetica with this feature active, and is presented with a choice of the 63 
        ampersand forms in that face.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The swsh table maps GIDs for default forms 
        to those for one or more corresponding swash forms. While many of these 
        substitutions are one-to-one (GSUB lookup type 1), others require a selection 
        from a set (GSUB lookup type 3). The manufacturer may choose to build two 
        tables (one for each lookup type) or only one which uses lookup type 3 for all 
        substitutions. If several styles of swash are present across the font, the set 
        of forms for each character should be ordered consistently.</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the swsh coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the swsh table and gets back one or more new 
        GIDs. If more than one GID is returned, the application must provide a means 
        for the user to select the one desired.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be inactive by default. When more 
        than one GID is returned, an application could display the forms sequentially 
        in context, or present a palette showing all the forms at once, or give the 
        user a choice between these approaches. The application may assume that the 
        first glyph in a set is the preferred form, so the font developer should order 
        them accordingly.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>Does not apply to ideographic scripts.</p>
       <p><i>Feature interaction: </i>This feature may be used in combination with 
        other substitution (GSUB) features, whose results it may override.</p>

       </p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>This feature replaces the default glyphs with corresponding 
        forms designed specifically for titling. These may be all-capital and/or larger 
        on the body, and adjusted for viewing at larger sizes.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user applies this feature in Adobe Garamond to get the 
        titling caps.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The titl table maps default forms to 
        corresponding titling forms (GSUB lookup type 1).</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the titl coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the titl table and gets back new GIDs.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be off by default.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>None.</p>
       <p><i>Feature interaction: </i>This feature may be used in combination with

        <a name="tnam"></a><b>Tag: </b>'tnam'</p>
       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Traditional Name Forms</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe</p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>Replaces 'simplified' Japanese kanji forms with the 
        corresponding 'traditional' forms. This is equivalent to the Traditional Forms 
        feature, but explicitly limited to the traditional forms considered proper for 
        use in personal names (as many as 205 glyphs in some fonts).</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user inputs U+4E9C and gets U+4E9E.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The tnam table maps simplified forms in a 
        font to corresponding traditional forms which can be used in personal names 
        (GSUB lookup type 1). The application stores a record of any simplified forms 
        which resulted from substitutions (the smpl feature); for such forms, applying 
        the tnam feature undoes the previous substitution.</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the tnam coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the table and gets back new GIDs. Note: This is 
        a change of character code. Besides the original character code, the 
        application should store the code for the new character.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be off by default.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>Applies only to Japanese.</p>
       <p><i>Feature interaction: </i>May include some characters affected by the 
        Proportional Alternate Widths feature (<a href="#palt">palt</a>); <a href="#trad">
         trad</a> and tnam are mutually exclusive, and override the results of 
<a href="#smpl">smpl</a>.</p>
       <p><br>
        <a name="tnum"></a><b>Tag: </b>'tnum'</p>
       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Tabular Figures</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe</p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>Replaces figure glyphs set on proportional widths with 
        corresponding glyphs set on uniform (tabular) widths. Tabular widths will 
        generally be the default, but this cannot be safely assumed. Of course this 
        feature would not be present in monospaced designs.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user may apply this feature to get oldstyle figures to 
        align vertically in a column.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>In order to simplify associated kerning 
        and get the best glyph design for a given width, this feature should use new 
        glyphs for the figures, rather than only adjusting the fit of the proportional 
        glyphs (although some may be simple copies); i.e. not a GPOS feature. The tnum 
        table maps proportional versions of lining &amp;/or oldstyle figures to 
        corresponding tabular glyphs (GSUB lookup type 1).</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the tnum coverage table, the 
        application passes GIDs to the tnum table and gets back new GIDs.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be off by default. The application 
        may want to query the user about this feature when the user changes figure 
        style (<a href="features_ko.htm#onum">onum</a> or <a href="features_ko.htm#lnum">lnum</a>).</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>None.</p>
       <p><i>Feature interaction: </i>This feature overrides the results of the 
        Proportional Figures feature (
<a href="#pnum">pnum</a>).</p>
       <p><br>
        <a name="trad"></a><b>Tag: </b>'trad'</p>
       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Traditional Forms</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe
       </p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>Replaces 'simplified' Chinese hanzi or Japanese kanji forms 
        with the corresponding 'traditional' forms.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user inputs U+53F0 and is offered a choice of U+6AAF, 
        U+81FA, or U+98B1.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The trad table maps each simplified form 
        in a font to one or more traditional forms. While many of these substitutions 
        are one-to-one (GSUB lookup type 1), others require a selection from a set 
        (GSUB lookup type 3). The manufacturer may choose to build two tables (one for 
        each lookup type) or only one which uses lookup type 3 for all substitutions. 
        As in any one-from-many substitution, alternates present in more than one face 
        should be ordered consistently across a family, so that those alternates can 
        work correctly when switching between family members.</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the trad coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the table and gets back one or more new GIDs. If 
        more than one GID is returned, the application must provide a means for the 
        user to select the one desired. The application stores a record of any 
        simplified forms which resulted from substitutions (the <a href="#smpl">smpl</a>
        feature); for such forms, applying the trad feature undoes the previous 
        substitution. Note: This is a change of character code. Besides the original 
        character code, the application should store the code for the new character.</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature should be inactive by default. If there's 
        no record of a conversion from traditional to simplified, the user must be 
        offered a set of possibilities from which to select. The application may note 
        the user's choice, and offer it as a default the next time the source 
        simplified character is encountered. In the absence of such prior information, 
        the application may assume that the first glyph in a set is the preferred form, 
        so the font developer should order them accordingly.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>Applies only to Chinese and Japanese.</p>
       <p><i>Feature interaction: </i>May include some characters affected by the 
        Proportional Alternate Widths feature (<a href='#palt"'?>palt</a>); trad and <a href="#tnam">
         tnam</a> are mutually exclusive, and override the results of <a href="#smpl">smpl</a>.</p>
       <p><br>
        <a name="twid"></a><b>Tag: </b>'twid'</p>
       <p><i>Friendly name: </i>Third Widths</p>
       <p><i>Registered by: </i>Adobe
       </p>
       <p><i>Function: </i>Replaces glyphs on other widths with glyphs set on widths of 
        one third of an em. The characters involved are normally figures and some forms 
        of punctuation.</p>
       <p><i>Example: </i>The user may apply twid to place a three-digit figure in a 
        single slot in a column of vertical text.</p>
       <p><i>Recommended implementation: </i>The font may contain alternate glyphs 
        designed to be set on third-em widths (GSUB lookup type 1), or it may specify 
        alternate metrics for the original glyphs (GPOS lookup type 1) which adjust 
        their spacing to fit in third-em widths.</p>
       <p><i>Application interface: </i>For GIDs found in the twid coverage table, the 
        application passes the GIDs to the table and gets back either new GIDs or 
        positional adjustments (XPlacement and XAdvance).</p>
       <p><i>UI suggestion: </i>This feature would normally be off by default.</p>
       <p><i>Script/language sensitivity: </i>Generally used only in CJKV fonts.</p>
       <p><i>Feature interaction: </i>This feature is mutually exclusive with all other 
        glyph-width features (e.g. <a href="features_fj.htm#fwid">fwid</a>, <a href="features_fj.htm#halt">halt</a>, <a href="features_fj.htm#hwid">
         hwid</a> and <a href="#qwid">qwid</a>), which should be turned off when it's 
        applied. It deactivates the <a href="features_ko.htm#kern">kern</a> feature.</p>
